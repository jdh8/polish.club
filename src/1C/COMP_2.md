# Competing at the 2-level

Competition at 1♣ (*) share properties of the following auctions:

- (*), as opener shows no suit yet
- 1NT (*), as opener shows only strength

## 1♣ (1NT)

Bidding against 1♣♦ (1NT) is analogous to a weak notrump.  The agreement to
borrow Landy 2♣ here is also called Landik.

| 1♣ (1NT)  | - |
|-----------|---|
| X         | PEN, INV+
| 2♣!       | UNBAL, 4+♠, 4+♥
| 2NT!      | UNBAL FG

## 1♣ (2♣)

Deem this situation as [1NT (2♣)](../../1NT/COMP_2.md#1NT(2C)).

## 1♣ (2♦♥♠) {#strawberry-adjunct}

[Rubinsohl](../../Rubinsohl.md) covers these auctions.  FunBridge also inspires
the **Strawberry adjunct** over 1m (2M):

| 1♣ (2M)  | - |
|----------|---|
| 3♥!      | FG, 5=OM
| 3♥-3♠!   | Ask for stopper
| 3♠!      | FG, 6+OM
