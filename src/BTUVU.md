# BTU vs Unusual

When opponents have bid two suits, optimists take the opportunity of gaining two
cuebids!  When opponents have shown two anchor suits, it's time for Unusual vs
Unusual.

## The third cuebid

This is one key difference between BTU vs Unusual and literature.  The BTU
variation uses the lowest **three** bids from the following list:

- The cuebids, the bids that name an adverse suit
- 2NT or 4NT

Let me provide some examples for clarity.

|      Auction      | BTU v U bids |
|-------------------|--------------|
| 1♦ (2♦ = ♠ + ♥)   | 2♥, 2♠, 2NT  |
| 1♠ (2NT = ♦ + ♣)  | 3♣, 3♦, 4♣   |
| 1♠ (3♣ = ♥ + ♦)   | 3♦, 3♥, 4♣   |
| 2♥ (4♦ = ♠ + ♦)   | 4♠, 4NT, 5♦  |
| (1♦-1♠)           | 2♦, 2♠, 2NT  |
| (1♦) 1♥ (X = ♠)   | 1♠, 2♦, 2♠   |

The BTU v U bids are abbreviated as **Q1, Q2, Q3** to facilitate discussion.  If
the cuebid is 4NT or above, I recommend that it start another slam try
convention (e.g. RKCB, Turbo) as per partnership discussion.

## We have one anchor suit

Rubens advances tell us that a fit requires less space.  Therefore, Q1 maps to
the new suit, and Q2 is the forcing raise.

1. Q1 = 5+ new suit
2. Q2 = forcing raise
3. Q3 = new suit + mediocre forcing raise

## We have 0 or 2 anchor suits

Unlike the intuitive [lower-lower] approach, BTU v U maps Q1 to the
**higher**-ranking suit.

[lower-lower]: https://www.acblunit390.org/Simon/unusvunus.htm

1. Q1 = 5+ **higher**-ranking suit
2. Q2 = 5+ **lower**-ranking suit
3. Q3 = 5+ lower-ranking suit, 4+ higher-ranking suit
