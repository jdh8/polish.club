# Natural 1♥

The major suit openings show 11--17 points and 5+ cards.  I separate them into
two chapters due to subtle differences in their continuations.

Responses to 1♥ are similar to natural 2/1 along with mixed fit-showing jumps.
The 2♠ response shows a 3-card limit raise and a 6-card side suit.

| 1♥-  | 11--17, 5+♥ |
|------|-------------|
| 1♠   | F, 4+♠
| 1NT  | Usually 7--11, 0--3♠, 0--3♥
| 2♣♦  | NAT FG
| 2♥   | CONST, 3+♥
| 2♠!  | LIM, 3=♥, 6+♠♦♣
| 2NT! | FG, 4+♥
| 3♣♦! | CONST+, 5+#, 4+♥
| 3♥   | LIM, 4+♥
| 3♠!  | SPL, 0--1♠, 4+♥
| 3NT! | COG, 12--15, 33(43)
| 4♣♦! | SPL, 0--1#, 4+♥
| 4♥!  | PRE, UNBAL 4+♥

## 1♥-2♠

The heavy-tailed limit raise promises 3-card support and a 6-card side suit.
This agreement is especially useful for spades.  Choice between 4♥♠ arises from
63(xx) but not 54(xx).

| 1♥-2♠ | LIM, 3=♥, 6+X |
|-------|---------------|
| 2NT!  | Invite 6+♠
| 3♣    | Invite 6+♣
| 3♦    | Invite 6+♦
| 3♥    | S/O

## P-1♥

P-1♥ reduces to a fairly natural system.  We can keep using [Stenberg
2NT](1H/2NT.md) because it assigns minimum hands to 3♣.

| P-1♥- | 11--17, 5+♥ |
|-------|-------------|
| 2♣♦   | INV, 5+#
| 2NT!  | INV, 4+♥
| 3♥!   | CONST, 4+♥
