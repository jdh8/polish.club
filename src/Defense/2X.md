## (2♣)X

**Rubens advances** suffice for (2♣)X because it is the lowest suit.

| 3♥!    | INV+ TRF, 5+♠
| 3♠!    | FG, usually 6+♦

## (2♦♥♠)X

**Rumpelsohl** by Paul van Rijckevorsel was published in The Bridge World,
October 1992.  Traditionally, (2X)X also start Lebensohl.  However, artificial
calls, even limited ones, are not meant to be passed with boring hands.  I
decide to modify the bidding structure for this subtle difference.  There are
several reasons to invite with 2NT.

- Bidding to (2X)X is not free.
- An invitational X usually lacks a stopper.

Therefore, 2NT includes NF clubs and balanced invitational hands.

| (2♦)X- | T/O |
|--------|-----|
| 2M     | NAT NF
| 2NT!   | LEB: 4+♣ or BAL INV
| 3♣!    | STAY
| 3♦!    | INV+, 5+♥
| 3♥!    | INV+, 5+♠
| 3♠!    | FG, 5+♣

| (2♥)X- | T/O |
|--------|-----|
| 2♠     | NAT NF
| 2NT!   | LEB: 4+♣ or BAL INV

| 3♦!    | STAY, 4=♠
| 3♥!    | INV+, 5+♠
| 3♠!    | FG, 5+♣

Again, [Larry Cohen's adjunct][larryco] swaps 3♥♠ over (2♠).
