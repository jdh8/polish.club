# BTU 3-way checkback (XYZ)

We use BTU-style 3-way checkback to an XYZ auction.  There are 3 artificial
relays in the 3-way checkback:

- **2♣:** several variants:
  - to play 2X
  - strongly shaped invitation
  - balanced invitation
  - special game force to rebid 3NT
- **2♦:** game-forcing checkback
- **2NT:** transfer to clubs

As a corollary, natural 2X are wide-range invitations and 3X become slam tries.
Compared with XYZ in literature, direct 2X are swapped with the variants in 2♣.
This is because invitations are prone to competition.

## By passed hand

There are definitely no slam tries by passed hand.  Direct 3X become strongly
shaped invitations without a doubt.  The debate is whether 2♦ is still an
artificial checkback.  To avoid confusion, I suggest keeping 2♦ artificial.
Openings in the third and fourth seat can be light.  Hence, 2♦ invites full
openers.

### The 2♦ game force

This game-forcing checkback probes 3-card support or a whole extra trick (about
15--17).  This strength cut helps slam investigation since the 2♣ checkback
asks for half-tricks.
