# Competing at the 2-level

Major-oriented transfer system competes well with (1NT).

| 1♦ (1NT)  | - |
|-----------|---|
| X         | PEN, nearly BAL INV+
| 2♣!       | TRF, 3+♦
| 2♦!       | TRF, 5+♥
| 2♥!       | TRF, 5+♠
| 2♠!       | TRF, 5+♣

| 3♣!       | TRF, PRE 7+♦ or FG 6+♦
| 3♦!       | TRF, PRE 7+♥ or FG 6+♥
| 3♥!       | TRF, PRE 7+♠ or FG 6+♠
| 3♠!       | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with no stopper outside
| 3NT!      | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with one stopper outside

As clubs are directly under diamonds, bidding after 1♦ (2♣) is pretty natural.

| 1♦ (2♣)  | - |
|----------|---|
| X!       | T/O, INV+
| 2♦       | CONST, 3+♦
| 2M       | NF, 5+#
| 2NT      | NAT INV
| 3♣!      | INV+, 4+♦
| 3♦       | PRE, 4+♦
| 3M       | FG, usually 6+#

Competition with 1♦ (2M) models after [Rubinsohl](../../Rubinsohl.md).  The
forcing raise 3♣ and the preemptive raise 3♦ weaponize the diamond fit.  [The
Strawberry adjunct](../1C/COMP_2.md#strawberry-adjunct) applies here just like
1♣ (2M).

| 1♦ (2M)  | - |
|----------|---|
| X!       | OPT, INV+
| 2♠       | NF, 5+♠
| 2NT!     | TRF, 5+♣
| 3♣!      | INV+, 3+♦
| 3♦       | PRE, 4+♦
| 3♥!      | FG, 5=OM
| 3♥-3♠!   | Ask for stopper
| 3♠!      | FG, 6+OM
