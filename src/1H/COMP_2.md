# Competing at the 2-level

## Over (1NT)

I suggest bidding mostly naturally over 1♥(1NT), including 2♣.

| 1♥(1NT) | - |
|---------|---|
| X       | PEN, INV+
| 2NT!    | LIM 4+♥ or UNBAL FG

## Over a minor suit

Transfers à la Rubens applies over 1♥(2♣♦).  Note that 2NT is natural because
we still have 2♥.

| 1♥(2♣♦) | - |
|---------|---|
| X       | T/O
| 2♦♠     | NF, 5+#
| 2♥      | NF, 3+♥
| 2NT     | NAT, 9--11
| 3♦!     | LIM+, 3+♥
| 3♥      | CONST, 4+♥
| 3♠      | FG, 6+♠

| 1♥(2♣) | - |
|--------|---|
| 3♣!    | INV+, 6+♦

| 1♥(2♦) | - |
|--------|---|
| 3♣     | INV, 6+♣

## Over a major suit

Rubinsohl applies when opponents bid spades, the only suit higher than our
hearts.  Responses 3♠ and above are the same as over [1♥(1♠)](COMP_1.md).

| 1♥(2♠) | - |
|--------|---|
| X!     | OPT, INV+
| 2NT!   | TRF, 5+♣

| 1♥(2♥♠) | - |
|---------|---|
| 3♣!     | TRF, 5+♦
| 3♦!     | INV+, 3+♥
| 3♥      | COMP, 3+♥
| 3♠!     | S/T, 3+♥ w/o ♠ CTRL
| 3NT!    | COG, 3+♥ w/ ♠ A/K
| 4♣!     | FRAG, 3+♥, 0--1♠
| 4♦!     | STR PRE, 4+♥
| 4♥      | PRE, UNBAL 4+♥

Doubling the cuebid is penalty oriented and lead directing.  It promises
strength, denies good distributional raise (balanced 3=♥ at most), and
encourages leading from a side suit.

| 1♥(2♥) | - |
|--------|---|
| X      | PEN, INV+

If the only known suit from (2♥) is spades, plain Rubens suffices.  X and 2NT
somehow switch roles.

| 1♥(2♥) | ♠ (+ unknown suit) |
|--------|--------------------|
| 2♠!    | TRF, 5+♣
| 2NT!   | NF T/O

If (2♥) shows two known suits, [BTU vs Unusual](../BTUVU.md) applies.
