# Natural 1♥-1♠

As the opening is limited to 12--17, the reverses are not forcing.  The reverses
show a maximum 5+ 5+ two suiter.

## BTU 3-way checkback

BTU checkback is also in effect after 1♥-1♠-1NT, similar to [1♦-1M-1NT][btucb].
There are 3 artificial relays in the 3-way checkback:

- **2♣:** several variants:
  - to play 2X
  - strongly shaped invitation
  - balanced invitation or choice of games
- **2♦:** game-forcing checkback, usually a choice of games
- **2NT:** transfer to clubs

As a corollary, natural 2X are wide-range invitations and 3X become slam tries.
