# Cuebids

Adverse calls may take away bidding space, but they can also grant us cuebids.
The natural meaning of a strain can be rendered infeasible in competition.
(Cooperative) penalty scores better than playing in an adverse strain (and at a
higher level).  Allocating useful artificial meaning to cuebids follows the
[useful space principle][usp] and is the key to fight back intervention.
