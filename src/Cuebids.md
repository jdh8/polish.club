# Cuebids

Adverse calls may take away bidding space, but they can also grant us cuebids.
The natural meaning of a strain can be rendered infeasible in competition.
(Cooperative) penalty scores better than playing in an adverse strain (and at a
higher level).  Allocating useful artificial meaning to cuebids follows the
[useful space principle][usp] and is the key to fight back intervention.

## Finding cuebids

Cuebids are obvious opposing a natural bid.  Locating cuebids over an artificial
call requires some discussion.

It is tempting to ignore opposing doubles.  However, I suggest using notrump as
cuebids over doubles.  XX shows interest in penalty with strength and a probable
misfit.  Since XX overlaps with the natural meaning of notrump, reusing notrump
as cuebids is more efficient.  This idea gave birth to [Truscott 2NT][truscott]
and [Rubens over 1♦♥♠(X)][rubens].

Aritificial calls are trickier.  Usually, the referred strains are used as
cuebids.  X, NT, and the nominal strain need specific agreements.
