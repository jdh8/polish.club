# Competing at the 2-level

Competition at 1♣ (*) share properties of the following auctions:

- (*), as opener shows no suit yet
- 1NT (*), as opener shows only strength

## 1♣ (1NT)

I recommend a transfer system below 3NT.  Since X frees up 2NT, 2NT and above
become transfers (cf. Rubens advances).  Below 2NT, continuations to
[1NT](../../1NT.md) form a major-oriented structure.  Such structure
allows bidding a 5-card major regardless of strength.

| 1♣ (1NT)  | - |
|-----------|---|
| X         | PEN, nearly BAL INV+
| 2♣!       | (Garbage) STAY; INV 5=♠
| 2♦!       | TRF, 5+♥
| 2♥!       | TRF, 5+♠
| 2♠!       | Minor suit Multi/STAY, 6+♦♣ or FG 4+♦ 4+♣
| 2NT!      | TRF, PRE 7+♣ or FG 6+♣
| 3♣!       | TRF, PRE 7+♦ or FG 6+♦
| 3♦!       | TRF, PRE 7+♥ or FG 6+♥
| 3♥!       | TRF, PRE 7+♠ or FG 6+♠
| 3♠!       | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with no stopper outside
| 3NT!      | Gambling, SOL 7+ suit with one stopper outside

## 1♣ (2♣)

Deem this situation as [1NT (2♣)](../../1NT/COMP_2.md#1NT(2C)).

## 1♣ (2♦♥♠) {#strawberry-adjunct}

[Rubinsohl](../../Rubinsohl.md) covers these auctions.  FunBridge also inspires
the **Strawberry adjunct** over 1m (2M):

| 1♣ (2M)  | - |
|----------|---|
| 3♥!      | FG, 5=OM
| 3♥-3♠!   | Ask for stopper
| 3♠!      | FG, 6+OM
