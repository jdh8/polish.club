# ![Strawberry Polish Club](favicon-743d6a64.svg)

I have been studying forcing club systems since reading *Good, Better, Best* by
Jan Eric Larsson, whose simulations show that forcing club systems tend to
outperform other systems.
I believe opening 1♣ for all strong hands is a superior treatment.

Strawberry Polish Club is a BTU-flavored Polish Club largely based on *Polish
Club 2020: Expert*.  Polish Club serves as a gateway to the world of forcing
clubs.  It is 5-card major.  Its main opening range is 12--17. Sharing these
properties, it has similar bidding structure to 2/1, the lingua franca of modern
bridge.

## Hand evaluation

- **HCP:** the well-known Milton Work's 4321 count
- **Total points:** HCP + distribution points (void = 3, singleton = 2, doubleton
  = 1, subtract 1 for each short suit with HCP)
- **Zar:** 6-4-2-1 + Zar distribution points (a + b + a - d, where the
  letters are the number of cards from the longest to the shortest suit)
- [**Fifths**](https://bridge.thomasoandrews.com/valuations/cardvaluesfor3nt.html):
  4.0--2.8--1.8--1.0--0.4, adjusted HCP for notrump contracts especially 3NT
- **BUM-RAP:** 4.5--3--1.5--0.75--0.25, adjusted HCP for suit contracts
- **NLTC:** Count 1.5--1.0--0.5 losers for each missing AKQ

NLTC is a good single hand evaluator but not very additive.  It suits preemptive
initial actions but not for showing supports.  I wrote a [blog article][nltc] on
that topic.

### Stopper

I evaluate stopper quality as [GIB] does.

- **Partial stop:** length + HCP = 4
- **Likely stop:** length + HCP = 5
- **Stop:** A, QJx, or length + HCP at least 7
- **Two stops:** length + HCP at least 8

## Punctuations

Descriptions in bidding tables are dense in information.  To make them concise,
I use [abbreviations suggested by WBF][abbr].  Besides, for natural reading
flow, I use usual punctuation marks to connect conditions.  Their meanings are
usually self-explanatory in a bidding table.

[abbr]: http://www.worldbridge.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Guidetocompletion.pdf

- **The comma (,)** works as **AND**.
- **The semicolon (;)** works as **OR**.
- **The colon (:)** follows general description of the call.

A notable example is the 1♣ opening in [Strawberry Polish Club](Openings.md).
