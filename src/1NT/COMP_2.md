# Competitive bidding

## 1NT (X)

I suggest [Terrorist's runout][run] regardless of what (X) means.  This runout
also applies to a conventional double, yet responder can also pass balanced
hands more often.

| 1NT (X) | - |
|---------|---|
| XX      | PEN
| 2♣!     | P/C, 5+♣ or 4+♦ 4+♠♥
| 2♦!     | P/C, 5+♦ or 4+♠ 4+♥
| 2M      | NF, 5+#
| 2NT!    | CUE, good unbalanced hand
| 3X      | PRE, 6+#

Opener often runs with clubs because it is hard for responder to do so.

| 1NT (X) P | - |
|-----------|---|
| XX        | 5+ suit
| 2♣!       | 4+♣, 4+ another suit

## 1NT (2♣) {#1NT(2C)}

*Systems on* is a decent approach over 1NT (2♣︎).  The overcall is somewhat
ignored, and X replaces the stolen bid of 2♣.  Since continuations to 1NT is
major suit oriented, it is crucial if (2♣) shows a major suit.

### (2♣) shows both majors

This kind of 2♣︎ requires extra care.  I recommend BTU vs Unusual.

| 1NT (2♣) | Both majors |
|----------|-------------|
| X        | PEN for either major
| 2♦       | NF, 5+♦
| 2♥!      | FG, 5+♦
| 2♠!      | INV+, 5+♣
| 2NT!     | LEB, PRE 6+♣ or FG (xx)45
| 3♣♦      | INV, 6+#
| 3♥♠!     | Ask for stopper in this suit

### (2♣) specifies one major

This position is analogous to [(1M) 1NT](../Defense/1Y/1NT.md).  X replaces
the Gladiator 2♣.

### (2♣) specifies no major

Ignore the (2♣) overcall.  X replaces the Stayman 2♣ as usual.

## 1NT (2♦♥♠)

[Rubinsohl](../../Rubinsohl.md) covers these auctions.

## 1NT (2NT)

[BTU vs Unusual](../BTUVU.md) suffices.

| 1NT (2NT) | 5+♦, 5+♣ |
|-----------|----------|
| X         | PEN
| 3♣!       | INV+, 5+♠
| 3♦!       | INV+, 5+♥
| 3♥♠       | NF, 5+#
| 3NT       | S/O
| 4♣!       | COG, 4+♠, 5+♥
