# Natural 1♦

This opening shows 5+♦ or unbalanced 4=♦ 1--5♣.
Unlike *Polish Club 2020*, I use standard (i.e. non-inverted) minor raises along
with mixed raises to maximize preemption.  This method utilizes the frequent 5th
diamond in the 1♦ opening.

Note that 1♦-2♣ is sometimes a phony suit.  It is the only way to bid a
game-forcing hand with long diamonds and no side major suit.

| 1♦- | 11--20, 4+♦ |
|-----|-------------|
| 1♥  | F, 4+♥, usually 6+
| 1♠  | F, 4+♠, usually 6+
| 1NT | NF, 6--10, 4+♣
| 2♣  | FG, 4+♣ or 4+♦
| 2♦  | CONST, 6--9, 4+♦
| 2♥! | P/C, 6--8, 4--5♥, 5=♠
| 2♠! | INV, 9--11, 5--6♠, 4=♥
| 2NT | BAL INV, 10--11
| 3♣! | INV, 9--11, 6+♣
| 3♦  | INV, 9--11, 4+♦
| 3M! | PRE, 3--6, 7+#
| 3NT | 11--15, 1--3♠, 1--3♥

## P-1♦ {#P-1D}

Game forcing 2♣ becomes a natural invitation.  Consequently, 2♠ is a limit raise
because it no longer takes care of clubs.

| P-1♦- | 11--20, 4+♦ |
|-------|-------------|
| 2♣    | INV, 5+♣, 0--3♠, 0--3♥
| 2♠!   | LIM, 3+♦
