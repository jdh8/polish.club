# Natural (1NT)

*Good, Better, Best* recommends using conventional double over a strong notrump.
We consider a natural notrump opening strong if at least half of the hands
contain 15+ HCP. For instance, 14--16 is considered strong but 13--15 is not.

Landy 2♣, showing both majors, is a simple and effective defense to any natural
notrump opening.  As for strength, I recommend 10--15 but 5--11 by passed hand.

| 2♣!    | UNBAL, 4+♠, 4+♥

| 2NT!   | UNT, 5+♦, 5+♣

The aritificial bids correspond to similar preemptive openings.
