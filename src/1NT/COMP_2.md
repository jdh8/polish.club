# Competitive bidding

## 1NT(X)

I suggest [Terrorist's runout][run] regardless of what (X) means.  This runout
also applies to a conventional double, yet responder can also pass balanced
hands more often.

[run]: https://www.ptt.cc/man/BridgeClub/D6D1/D49B/D823/DD4E/M.1160796412.A.8E9.html

| 1NT(X) | - |
|--------|---|
| XX     | PEN
| 2♣!    | P/C, 5+♣ or 4+♦ 4+♠♥
| 2♦!    | P/C, 5+♦ or 4+♠ 4+♥
| 2M     | NF, 5+#
| 2NT!   | CUE, good unbalanced hand
| 3X     | PRE, 6+#

Opener often runs with clubs because it is hard for responder to do so.

| 1NT(X)P | - |
|---------|---|
| XX      | 5+ suit
| 2♣!     | 4+♣, 4+ another suit

## 1NT(2♣) {#1NT(2C)}

*Systems on* is a decent approach over 1NT(2♣︎).  The overcall is somewhat
ignored, and X replaces the stolen bid of 2♣.  Since continuations to 1NT is
major suit oriented, it is crucial if (2♣) shows a major suit.

### (2♣) shows both majors

This kind of 2♣︎ requires extra care.  I recommend BTU vs Unusual.

| 1NT(2♣) | Both majors |
|---------|-------------|
| X       | PEN for either major
| 2♦      | NF, 5+♦
| 2♥!     | FG, 5+♦
| 2♠!     | INV+, 5+♣
| 2NT!    | LEB, PRE 6+♣ or FG (xx)45
| 3♣♦     | INV, 6+#
| 3♥♠!    | Ask for stopper in this suit

### (2♣) specifies one major

This position is analogous to [(1M)1NT](../Defense/1Y/1NT.md).  X replaces
the Gladiator 2♣.

### (2♣) specifies no major

Ignore the (2♣) overcall.  X replaces the Stayman 2♣ as usual.

## 1NT(2♦♥♠)

Rubinsohl covers these auctions.  Similar to Rubens advances, the transfer
structure helps saving bidding space. Showing the suit faster also helps
competition.

| 1NT(2♦) | - |
|---------|---|
| X       | OPT
| 2M      | NAT NF
| 2NT!    | TRF to 3♣
| 3♣!     | STAY
| 3♦!     | INV+ TRF to 3♥
| 3♥!     | INV+ TRF to 3♠
| 3♠!     | FG TRF to 3NT or 4♣

| 1NT(2♥) | - |
|---------|---|
| X       | OPT
| 2♠      | NAT NF
| 2NT!    | TRF to 3♣
| 3♣!     | TRF to 3♦
| 3♦!     | STAY
| 3♥!     | INV+ TRF to 3♠
| 3♠!     | FG TRF to 3NT or 4♣

Swap 3♥♠ against (2♠) like [Larry Cohen][larryco] to avoid declaring hearts.

| 1NT(2♠) | - |
|---------|---|
| X       | OPT
| 2NT!    | TRF to 3♣
| 3♣!     | TRF to 3♦
| 3♦!     | TRF to 3♥
| 3♥!     | FG TRF to 3NT or 4♣
| 3♠!     | FG STAY

## 1NT(2NT)

[BTU vs Unusual](../BTUVU.md) suffices.

| 1NT(2NT) | 5+♦, 5+♣ |
|----------|----------|
| X        | PEN
| 3♣!      | INV+, 5+♠
| 3♦!      | INV+, 5+♥
| 3♥♠      | NF, 5+#
| 3NT      | S/O
| 4♣!      | COG, 4+♠, 5+♥
