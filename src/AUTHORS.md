I am Chen-Pang He (何震邦).  I have been studying forcing club systems since
reading *Good, Better, Best* by Jan Eric Larsson, whose simulations show that
forcing club systems tend to outperform other systems.  I believe opening 1♣ for
all strong hands is a superior treatment.

I play bridge in BTU, the bridge club at National Taiwan University.  I usually
discuss bidding methods with:

- 葉庭佑 (Ting-Yu Ye)
- 黃順捷 "Steven Jocker"

We are also influenced by Bo-Yin Yang "Terrorist", our legendary bidding theorist.

## My other bidding systems

- [Blueberry Precision Club](https://jdh8.github.io/blueberry-precision/)
- [Watermelon Dutch Doubleton](https://jdh8.github.io/watermelon-dutch/)
