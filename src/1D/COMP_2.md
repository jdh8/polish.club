# Competing at the 2-level

Bidding against 1♣♦(1NT) is analogous to a weak notrump.  The agreement to
borrow Landy 2♣ here is also called Landik.

| 1♦(1NT) | - |
|---------|---|
| X       | PEN, INV+
| 2♣!     | UNBAL, 4+♠, 4+♥
| 2NT!    | UNBAL FG

As clubs are directly under diamonds, bidding after 1♦(2♣) is pretty natural.

| 1♦(2♣) | - |
|--------|---|
| X!     | T/O, INV+
| 2♦     | PRE, 4+♦
| 2M     | NF, 5+#
| 2NT    | NAT INV
| 3♣!    | INV+, 4+♦
| 3♦     | CONST, 4+♦
| 3M     | FG, usually 6+#

Competition with 1♦(2M) models after [Rubinsohl](../../Rubinsohl.md).  The
forcing raise 3♣ and the preemptive raise 3♦ weaponize the diamond fit.  [The
Strawberry adjunct](../1C/COMP_2.md#strawberry-adjunct) applies here just like
1♣(2M).

| 1♦(2M) | - |
|--------|---|
| X!     | OPT, INV+
| 2♠     | NF, 5+♠
| 2NT!   | TRF, 5+♣
| 3♣!    | INV+, 4+♦
| 3♦     | NF, 4+♦
| 3♥!    | FG, 5=OM
| 3♥-3♠! | Ask for stopper
| 3♠!    | FG, 6+OM
