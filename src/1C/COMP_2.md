# Competing at the 2-level

Bidding against 1♣(1NT) is analogous to a weak notrump.  The agreement to
borrow Landy 2♣ here is also called Landik.

| 1♣(1NT) | - |
|---------|---|
| X       | PEN, INV+
| 2♣!     | UNBAL, 4+♠, 4+♥
| 2NT!    | UNBAL FG

Otherwise, treat 1♣(2*) like [1NT(2*)](../1NT/COMP_2.md).  Opener has shown no
suit but strength.
