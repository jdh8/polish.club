# Non-forcing 1NT

Opener is free to pass 1♥-1NT with a balanced minimum.  The best major fit at
1♥-1NT-P is balanced 5-3.  Opener can judge when to pass quite safely.

| 1♥-1NT | Usually 7--11, 0--3♠, 0--3♥ |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| 2♣     | 11--17, 2+♣
| 2♦     | 11--17, 3+♦
| 2♥     | 11--14, 6+♥
| 2♠     | 15--17, 4+♠
| 2NT!   | 15--17, 6=♥, ≤ ♥AJ9
| 3♣♦    | 15--17, 5+#
| 3♥     | 15--17, 6+♥, AJT+ or 7+♥
| 3♠     | 15--17, 4+♠, 6+♥
| 3NT!   | Gambling, 7+♥ AKQ, no outside A/K

Just like [1♠-1NT](../1S/1NT.md), the threshold of suit quality is based on
[Binky Points][binky].

## Impossible spades

As 1NT denies 4+♠, the 2♠ rebid must be artificial.  The **impossible 2♠** is a
forcing raise that is stronger than a courtesy raise.

| 2♦         | NF, 5+♦
| 2♥         | NF, usually 2--3♥

| 3♣         | Mild INV, usually 5+♣
| 3♦         | INV, 6+♦
| 3♥         | INV, 3=♥
