# Natural 1♠

The major suit openings show 11--17 points and 5+ cards.  I separate them into
two chapters due to subtle differences in their continuations.

- Maggie 1♠-2♣ is either a natural game force or a heart invitation.
  - Responder bids 1♠-2♦ with a minimum (--14) game force of 4=♦ and 4--5♣.
- Fit-showing jumps show mixed raises.
- For choice between 4♥♠, 1♠-3♥ expresses an invitation with 36(xx) rather than
  mixed raise with 45(xx).

| 1♠-  | 11--17, 5+♠ |
|------|-------------|
| 1NT  | Usually 7--11, 0--3♠
| 2♣!  | NAT FG or INV 5--6♥
| 2♦   | FG, 4+♦
| 2♥   | FG, 5+♥
| 2♠   | CONST, 3+♠
| 2NT! | FG, 4+♠
| 3♣♦! | CONST+, 5+#, 4+♠
| 3♥!  | INV, 6+♥, 3=♠
| 3♠   | LIM, 4+♠
| 3NT! | COG, 12--15, 33(43)
| 4X!  | SPL, 0--1#, 4+♠
| 4♠   | PRE, UNBAL 4+♠

## Responding with 5+ hearts

- **Game-forcing:** 2♥
- **Strong invitational 6+ hearts:** 1NT and then 3♥
- **Invitational:** 2♣
- **Constructive:** 1NT and then 2♥

## P-1♠

P-1♠ reduces to a fairly natural system.  We can keep using [Stenberg
2NT](1S/2NT.md) because it assigns minimum hands to 3♣.

| P-1♠- | 11--17, 5+♠ |
|-------|-------------|
| 1NT   | NF, usually 7--11, 0--3♠
| 2♣♦♥  | INV, 5+#
| 2NT!  | INV, 4+♠
