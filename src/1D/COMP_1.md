# Competing at the 1-level

This part shares similarities with [the 1♣ opening](../1C/COMP_1.md).
There are also differences since 1♦ shows a long suit that allows further
preempts.

- Notrump transfers to clubs as its natural meaning is not very useful.
- Unlike 1♣ (X), there is no space for Transfer Walsh here.
- Reuse 1♦ (X) 2♣ for Flannery because the rebidding problem persists.

| 1♦ (X)   | - |
|----------|---|
| XX       | NF BAL G/T, 10+
| 1M       | F, 7+, 4+#
| 1NT!     | TRF, 7+, 5+♣
| 2♣!      | ART, 5--11, 5+♠, 4+♥
| 2♦       | PRE, 0--7, 4+♦
| 2M       | PRE, 0--7, 6+#
| 2NT!     | TRF, PRE 7+♣ or FG 6+♣
| 3♣!      | INV+ TRF, 4+♦
| 3♦       | CONST, 8--10, 4+♦
| 3M       | PRE, 7+#

Spades below 3NT are transfer cuebids.

| 1♦ (1M) | - |
|---------|---|
| 1NT     | NAT, 8--10
| 2♣      | NF, 8--11, 5+♣
| 2♦      | PRE, 0--7, 4+♦
| 2♠!     | INV+ T/O, no other suitable call
| 2NT     | NAT INV, 10--11
| 3♣!     | INV+ TRF, 4+♦
| 3♦      | CONST, 8--10, 4+♦
| 4OM     | To play
| 4M!     | S/T, ask for CTRL

Transfer Walsh only applies to 1♦ (1♥), the only 1-level red suit.

| 1♦ (1♥) | - |
|---------|---|
| X!      | TRF, 7+, 4+♠
| 1♠!     | TRF to 1NT, 8+
| 2♥!     | TRF, 6+♠
| 3♥!     | INV+ TRF, 6+♠
| 3♠!     | FG, 6+♣

The whole bidding structure leans toward hearts over (1♠).  A well-known example
is the negative double.

| 1♦ (1♠) | - |
|---------|---|
| X!      | TRF, 7+, 4+♥
| 2♥      | NF, 5+♥, 7--11 or 6+♥
| 3♥      | INV, 6+♥
| 3♠!     | FG, 6+♥
