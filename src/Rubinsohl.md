# Rubinsohl

Rubinsohl is a bidding convention aiming for competition at the 2-level.
Originally, for auctions such as 1NT(2♦♥♠), use 2NT and some steps above to
convey conventional meanings.  I am generalizing onset conditions as follows:

1. Partner has ever bid a non-pass.
2. Moreover, the last non-pass is (2♦♥♠) by either opponent.

If the last non-pass is an artificial call by partner, such as a takeout double,
I recommend [Rumpelsohl](#rumpelsohl) instead.

Similar to Rubens advances, the transfer structure helps saving bidding space.
Showing the suit faster also helps competition.

| *(2♦) | - |
|-------|---|
| X     | OPT
| 2M    | NAT NF
| 2NT!  | TRF to 3♣
| 3♣!   | STAY
| 3♦!   | INV+ TRF to 3♥
| 3♥!   | INV+ TRF to 3♠
| 3♠!   | FG TRF to 3NT or 4♣

| *(2♥) | - |
|-------|---|
| X     | OPT
| 2♠    | NAT NF
| 2NT!  | TRF to 3♣
| 3♣!   | TRF to 3♦
| 3♦!   | STAY
| 3♥!   | INV+ TRF to 3♠
| 3♠!   | FG TRF to 3NT or 4♣

Swap 3♥♠ against (2♠) like [Larry Cohen][larryco] to avoid declaring hearts.

## Rumpelsohl

Rumpelsohl by Paul van Rijckevorsel was published in The Bridge World, October
1992\.  Traditionally, (2X)X also start Lebensohl.  However, artificial calls,
even limited ones, are not meant to be passed with boring hands.  I decide to
modify the bidding structure for this subtle difference.

1. The last bid is 2♦♥♠
2. The last non-pass is an artificial call by partner.

In this section, I list (2X)X as examples.  The meaning of each step varies
with partner's call.  There are several reasons to invite with 2NT.

- Bidding to (2X)X is not free.
- An invitational X usually lacks a stopper.

Therefore, 2NT includes NF clubs and constructive-invitational hands.

| (2♦)X- | T/O |
|--------|-----|
| 2M     | NAT NF
| 2NT!   | LEB: 4+♣ or CONST--INV
| 3♣!    | STAY
| 3♦!    | INV+, 5+♥
| 3♥!    | INV+, 5+♠
| 3♠!    | FG, 5+♣

| (2♥)X- | T/O |
|--------|-----|
| 2♠     | NAT NF
| 2NT!   | LEB: 4+♣ or CONST--INV
| 3♣!    | TRF, 4+♦
| 3♦!    | STAY, 4=♠
| 3♥!    | INV+, 5+♠
| 3♠!    | FG, 5+♣

Again, [Larry Cohen's adjunct][larryco] swaps 3♥♠ over (2♠).

| (2♠)X- | T/O |
|--------|-----|
| 2NT!   | LEB: 3+♣ or CONST--INV
| 3♣!    | TRF, 4+♦
| 3♦!    | TRF, 4+♥
| 3♥!    | FG, 5+♣
| 3♠!    | FG STAY, 4=♥
