# Forcing 1NT

Unpassed 1♠-1NT is forcing to accommodate strong invitations, especially 6+♥,
which is one step away from 4♥.

| 1♠-1NT | Usually 7--11, 0--3♠ |
|--------|----------------------|
| 2♣     | 11--17, 2+♣
| 2♦     | 11--17, 4+♦
| 2♥     | 11--15, 4+♥
| 2♠     | 11--14, 6+♠
| 2NT!   | 15--17, 6=♠, ≤ ♠AJ9
| 3♣♦♥   | 15--17, 5+#
| 3♠     | 15--17, 6+♠, AJT+ or 7+♠
| 3NT!   | Gambling, 7+♠ AKQ, no outside A/K

If you wish to invite with 4=♥, you are on the wrong path.  You should have
opened [Ekren 2♣](../2C.md) instead.

The threshold of suit quality is based on [Binky Points][binky]:

## Precision 2NT

The invitational 2NT from Precision shows 6 cards in the bid major.  However, I
had a hard time finding its continuations.  Therefore, I came up with the following
responses to find better games, especially 4♥.

| 1♠-1NT 2NT- | 15--17, 6=♠ |
|-------------|-------------|
| 3♣!         | PUP
| 3♦!         | FG, 6+♦ or 5--6♥
| 3♥          | FG, 6+♥

| 1♠-1NT 2NT-3♣ | PUP |
|---------------|-----|
| 3♦-P          | S/O, 6+♦
| 3♦-3♥         | S/O, 6+♥
| 3♦-3♠+        | FG, 6+♣
