# Non-forcing 1NT

Opener is free to pass 1♥-1NT with a balanced minimum.  The best major fit at
1♥-1NT-P is balanced 5-3.  Opener can judge when to pass quite safely.

| 1♥-1NT | Usually 7--11, 0--3♠, 0--3♥ |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| 2♣     | 11--17, 2+♣
| 2♦     | 11--17, 3+♦
| 2♥     | 11--14, 6+♥
| 2♠     | 15--17, 4+♠
| 2NT!   | 15--17, 6=♥, ≤ ♥AJ9
| 3♣♦    | 15--17, 5+#
| 3♥     | 15--17, 6+♥, AJT+ or 7+♥
| 3♠     | 15--17, 4+♠, 6+♥
| 3NT!   | Gambling, 7+♥ AKQ, no outside A/K

Just like [1♠-1NT](../1S/1NT.md), the threshold of suit quality is based on
[Binky Points][binky].

## Impossible spades

Spades that responder rebids must be artificial because 1NT already denies
spades.  The impossible 2♠ asks for a stopper in spades before subsequent
invitations. Direct invitations are otherwise indifferent to quality in spades.
